# Blackjack
The human player starts.
At the start, the player gets 2 random numbers. 
The random numbers are summed up. 
The player can then choose to hold or roll again the dice. 
If they choose to roll again, numbers are added to the previous sum. 
If the player holds, it is the computerâ€™s turn. 
The closest to 21 without going over is the winner. 
The random numbers will be no larger than 6
In the event of both players finishing with identical scores, a tie is declared
